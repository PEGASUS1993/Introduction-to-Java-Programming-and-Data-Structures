Chapter 6 Methods
Sections 6.2 Defining a Method
1. Suppose your method does not return any value, which of the following keywords can be used as a return type?
a.	void
b.	int
c.	double
d.	public
e.	None of the above
Key:a

#
2.	The signature of a method consists of ____________.
a.	method name 
b.	method name and parameter list
c.	return type, method name, and parameter list
d.	parameter list
Key:b By definition, a method signature consists of method name and parameter list.
	
#
3.	All Java applications must have a method __________.
a.	public static Main(String[] args)
b.	public static Main(String args[])
c.	public static void main(String[] args)
d.	public void main(String[] args)
e.      public static main(String[] args)
Key:c Java application's starting method is the main method.

#
Sections 6.3 Calling a Method	
4.	Arguments to methods always appear within __________.
a.	brackets
b.	parentheses
c.	curly braces
d.	quotation marks
Key:b 

#
5.	Does the return statement in the following method cause compile errors?

public static void main(String[] args) {
  int max = 0;
  if (max != 0)
    System.out.println(max);
  else
    return;
}
a.	Yes
b.	No
Key:b It is rare, but sometimes useful to have a return statement for circumventing the normal flow of control in a void method. 

#
6.	Does the method call in the following method cause compile errors?

public static void main(String[] args) {
  Math.pow(2, 4);
}
a.	Yes
b.	No
Key:b A value-returning method can also be invoked as a statement in Java. In this case, the caller simply ignores the return value. This is rare, but permissible if the caller is not interested in the return value.

#
7. Each time a method is invoked, the system stores parameters and local variables in an area of memory, known as _______, which stores elements in last-in first-out fashion.
a. a heap
b. storage area
c. a stack
d. an array
key:c 

#
Sections 6.4 void vs. Value-Returning Methods
8. Which of the following should be defined as a void method?
a. Write a method that prints integers from 1 to 100.
b. Write a method that returns a random integer from 1 to 100.
c. Write a method that checks whether a number is from 1 to 100.
d. Write a method that converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.
key:a

#
9. You should fill in the blank in the following code with ______________.

    printGrade(59.5);
  }

  public static __________ printGrade(double score) {

    } 
    else if (score >= 80.0) {
      System.out.println('B');
    } 
    else if (score >= 70.0) {
      System.out.println('C');
    }

      System.out.println('F');
    }
  }
}


a. int 
b. double
c. boolean
d. char
e. void
key:e  void should here because the method does not return any value.

#

      return 'A';
    else if (score >= 80.0)
      return 'B';
    else if (score >= 70.0)
      return 'C';
    else if (score >= 60.0)
      return 'D';
    else
      return 'F';
  }
}

a. int 
b. double
c. boolean
d. char
e. void
key:d  char should be placed here because the method returns a character.

    n--;
  }
}

What is the output of the call nPrint('a', 4)?
a.	aaaaa
b.	aaaa
c.	aaa
d.	invalid call
Key:d Invalid call because char 'a' cannot be passed to string message
	
#

Section 6.8 Overloading Methods
15. Analyze the following code:

    System.out.println("int, long");
    return n;
  }

  public static long xMethod(long n, long l) {
    System.out.println("long, long");
    return n;
  }
}
a.	The program displays int, long followed by 5.
b.	The program displays long, long followed by 5.
c.	The program runs fine but displays things other than 5.
d.	The program does not compile because the compiler cannot distinguish which xmethod to invoke.

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(xmethod(5));
  }

  public static int xmethod(int n, long t) {
    System.out.println("int");
    return n;
  }

  public static long xmethod(long n) {
    System.out.println("long");
    return n;
  }
}
a. The program displays int followed by 5.
b. The program displays long followed by 5.
c. The program runs fine but displays things other than 5.
d. The program does not compile because the compiler cannot distinguish which xmethod to invoke.
Key:b
	
#	
17. Analyze the following code.

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    System.out.println(max(1, 2));  
  }

  public static double max(int num1, double num2) {
    System.out.println("max(int, double) is invoked");

    if (num1 > num2)
      return num1;
    else
      return num2;
  }
  
  public static double max(double num1, int num2) {
    System.out.println("max(double, int) is invoked");

    if (num1 > num2)
      return num1;
    else
      return num2;     
  }
}
a. The program cannot compile because you cannot have the print statement in a non-void method.
b. The program cannot compile because the compiler cannot determine which max method should be invoked.
c. The program runs and prints 2 followed by "max(int, double)" is invoked.
d. The program runs and prints 2 followed by "max(double, int)" is invoked.
e. The program runs and prints "max(int, double) is invoked" followed by 2.
Key:b This is known as ambiguous method invocation.

#	
18. Analyze the following code.

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args)  {
    System.out.println(m(2));  
  }

  public static int m(int num) {
    return num;
  }
  
  public static void m(int num) {
    System.out.println(num);
  }
}
a. The program has a compile error because the two methods m have the same signature.
b. The program has a compile error because the second m method is defined, but not invoked in the main method.
c. The program runs and prints 2 once.
d. The program runs and prints 2 twice.
Key:a You cannot override the methods based on the type returned.

  int k = 2;
  nPrint("A message", k);
}
System.out.println(k);

a.	0
b.	1
c.	2
d.	k is not defined outside the block. So, the program has a compile error
Key:d k is defined inside the block. Outside the block, k is not defined.
