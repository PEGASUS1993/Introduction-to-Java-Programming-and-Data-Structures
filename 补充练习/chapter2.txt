a. x is 1.
b. x is 2.	
c. x is 3.

Section 2.14 Increment and Decrement Operators
48.	Are the following four statements equivalent?

  number += 1;
  number = number + 1;
  number++;
  ++number;
a. Yes
b. No
Key:a

#
49. What is i printed?

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int j = 0;
    int i = ++j + j * 5;

    System.out.println("What is i? " + i);
  }
}
a. 0
b. 1
c. 5
d. 6
Key:d Operands are evaluated from left to right in Java. The left-hand operand of a binary operator is evaluated before any part of the right-hand operand is evaluated. This rule takes precedence over any other rules that govern expressions. Therefore, ++j is evaluated first, and j is now 1. Then j * 5 is evaluated, returns 5. So, i is 6.

#
50. What is i printed in the following code?

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int j = 0;
    int i = j++ + j * 5;

    System.out.println("What is i? " + i);
  }
}
a. 0
b. 1
c. 5
d. 6
Key:c Operands are evaluated from left to right in Java. The left-hand operand of a binary operator is evaluated before any part of the right-hand operand is evaluated. This rule takes precedence over any other rules that govern expressions. Therefore, j++ is evaluated first. j is now 1. Since j++ is postincrement, the old value of j is returned for j++. So j++ + j * 5 equals 0 + 1 * 5. So, the result is 5.

#
51. What is y displayed in the following code?

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 1;
    int y = x++ + x;
    System.out.println("y is " + y);
  }  
}
a. y is 1.
b. y is 2.
c. y is 3.
d. y is 4.
Key:c When evaluating x++ + x, x++ is evaluated first, which does two things: 1. returns 1 since it is post-increment. x becomes 2. Therefore y is 1 + 2.

#
52. What is y displayed?

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 1;
    int y = x + x++;
    System.out.println("y is " + y);
  }  
}
a. y is 1.
b. y is 2.
c. y is 3.
d. y is 4.
Key:b When evaluating x + x++, x is evaluated first, which is 1. X++ returns 1 since it is post-increment and 2. Therefore y is 1 + 1.

#
Section 2.15 Numeric Type Conversions
53.	To assign a double variable d to a float variable x, you write
a.	x = (long)d
b.	x = (int)d;

54. Which of the following expressions will yield 0.5?
a. 1 / 2
b. 1.0 / 2
c. (double) (1 / 2)
d. (double) 1 / 2
e. 1 / 2.0

int y = (int)x;
System.out.println("x is " + x + " and y is " + y);

b. x is 6.0 and y is 6.0
c. x is 6 and y is 6
d. x is 5.5 and y is 5
e. x is 5.5 and y is 5.0

Section 2.18 Common Errors and Pitfalls
64.	Analyze the following code:

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 10000 * 10000 * 10000;
    System.out.println("n is " + n);
  }
}
a.	The program displays n is 1000000000000.
b.	The result of 10000 * 10000 * 10000 is too large to be stored in an int variable n. This causes an overflow and the program is aborted. 
c.	The result of 10000 * 10000 * 10000 is too large to be stored in an int variable n. This causes an overflow and the program continues to execute because Java does not report errors on overflow. 
d.	The result of 10000 * 10000 * 10000 is too large to be stored in an int variable n. This causes an underflow and the program is aborted. 
e.  The result of 10000 * 10000 * 10000 is too large to be stored in an int variable n. This causes an underflow and the program continues to execute because Java does not report errors on underflow.      
Key:c
