Key:abcde

#
3. Which of the following statements are true?
a. MyArrayList and MyLinkedList are two concrete implementations of MyList.

c. MyLinkedList is implemented using a linked structure.
d. A linked structure consists of nodes. Each node is dynamically created to hold an element. All the nodes are linked together to form a list. 
e. MyAbstractList partially implements MyList.
Key:abcde

#
4. In the implementation of MyArrayList, which of the following are true?

e. capacity is reduced by 1 if an element is deleted from the list.
Key:abd (C) is not correct because capacity may equal to size.

#
5. In the implementation of MyArrayList, which of the following are true?

b. capacity never reduces.
c. Inside MyArrayList, a regular array is used to store elements.
d. size is not declared in MyArrayList, but declared in MyAbstractList as protected.

Section 24.4 Linked Lists
6. In the implementation of MyLinkedList, which of the following are true?
a. MyLinkedList contains all the methods defined in MyList. Additionally, MyLinkedList defines several new methods that are appropriate for processing a linked list.
b. MyArrayList does not introduce new methods. All the methods in MyArrayList are defined in MyList. 
c. You can use a linked list to improve efficiency for adding and removing an element anywhere in a list.
d. You should use an array list if your application does not require adding and removing an element anywhere in a list. 
Key:abcd

#
7. In the implementation of MyLinkedList, which of the following are true?
a. Node is defined as an inner class inside MyLinkedList.
b. Node is defined as a static inner class inside MyLinkedList because it does not reference any instance data fields in MyLinkedList.
c. Node has a property named next that links to the node after this node.
d. Node has a property named element that stores an element.
Key:abcd

#
8. In the implementation of MyLinkedList, which of the following are true?
a. MyLinkedList has a capacity property.
b. MyLinkedList has the properties named first and last to point to the nodes in a linked list.
c. If a linked list is empty, first is null and last is null.
d. If a linked list contains one element, first points to the node and last is null.
e. last.next is always null.
Key:bce (D) is partially wrong, last and first points to the same node if a linked list contains one node.

#
9. ArrayList is more efficient than LinkedList for the following operations:
a. Insert/delete an element in the middle of the list.
b. Insert/delete an element in the beginning of the list.
c. Insert/delete an element at the end of the list.
d. Retrieve an element given the index.
Key:d 

#
10. LinkedList is more efficient than ArrayList for the following operations:
a. Insert/delete an element in the middle of the list.
b. Insert/delete an element in the beginning of the listc. Insert/delete an element at the end of the list.
d. Retrieve an element given the index.
Key:ab

Section 24.5 Stacks and Queues
16. Which of the following are true?
a. A stack can be viewed as a special type of list, where the elements are accessed, inserted, and deleted only from the end, called the top, of the stack.
b. A queue represents a waiting list. A queue can be viewed as a special type of list, where the elements are inserted into the end (tail) of the queue, and are accessed and deleted from the beginning (head) of the queue. 
c. Since the insertion and deletion operations on a stack are made only at the end of the stack, using an array list to implement a stack is more efficient than a linked list. 
d. Since deletions are made at the beginning of the list, it is more efficient to implement a queue using a linked list than an array list.
