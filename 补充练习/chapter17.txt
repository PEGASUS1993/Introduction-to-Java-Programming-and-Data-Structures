Section 17.3 Text I/O vs. Binary I/O
2. Which of the following statements are true?
a. Text I/O is built upon binary I/O to provide a level of abstraction for character encoding and decoding.
b. Text I/O involves encoding and decoding.
c. Binary I/O does not require conversions.

a.	It creates a new file named test.dat if it does not exist and opens the file so you can write to it.
b.	It creates a new file named test.dat if it does not exist and opens the file so you can write to it and read from it.
c.	It creates a new file named test.dat regardless of whether it exists or not and opens the file so you can write to it.
d.	It creates a new file named test.dat regardless of whether it exists or not and opens the file so you can write to it and read from it.
e. It creates a FileInputStream for test.dat if test.dat exists.
Key:e

#
9. After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeShort(1234);
    output.writeShort(5678);
    output.close();
  }
}
a. 2 bytes.
b. 4 bytes.
c. 8 bytes.
d. 16 bytes.
Key:b Each short number takes 2 bytes. So total is 4 bytes.

#
10. After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeChar('A');
    output.close();
  }
}
a. 2 bytes.
b. 4 bytes.
c. 8 bytes.
d. none of the above.
Key:a Two bytes of Unicode for 'A' is written

#
11. After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeChars("ABCD");
    output.close();
  }
}
a. 2 bytes.
b. 4 bytes.
c. 8 bytes.
d. 12 bytes.
e. 16 bytes.
Key:c Two bytes of Unicode for each character is written to output.

#
12. After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeUTFString("ABCD");
    output.close();
  }
}
a. 2 bytes.
b. 4 bytes.
c. 6 bytes.
d. 8 bytes.
e. 10 bytes.
Key:c "ABCD" are ASCII code, so each takes one byte in UTF. Total is 6 because the first two bytes stores the number of characters in the string.

#
13. Which of the following statements are true?
a. All files are stored in binary format. So, all files are essentially binary files.
b. Text I/O is built upon binary I/O to provide a level of abstraction for character encoding and decoding. 
c. Encoding and decoding are automatically performed by text I/O. 
d. For binary input, you need to know exactly how data were written in order to read them in correct type and order. 
Key:abcd

#
Section 17.6 Object I/O 
14. Which of the following statements are true?
a. ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream enables you to perform I/O for objects in addition for primitive type values and strings.
b. Since ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream contains all the functions of DataInputStream/DataOutputStream, you can replace DataInputStream/DataOutputStream completely by ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream. 
c. To write an object, the object must be serializable.
d. The Serializable interface does not contain any methods. So it is a mark interface.
e. If all the elements in an array is serializable, the array is serializable too.
Key:abcde

#
15. The Loan class given in the text does not implement java.io.Serializable. Analyze the following code.

public class Foo implements java.io.Serializable {  
  private int v1;
  private static double v2;
  private Loan v3 = new Loan();  
}
a. An instance of Foo can be serialized because Foo implements Serializable.
b. An instance of Foo cannot be serialized because Foo contains a non-serializable instance variable v3.
c. If you mark v3 as transient, an instance of Foo is serializable.
Key:bc An object may not be serialized even though its class implements java.io.Serializable, because it may contain non-serializable instance variables.

#
16. Which of the following statements is not true?

a. A static variable is not serialized.
b. A transient variable is not serialized.
c. An object must be an instance of Serializable or Externalizable for it to be serialized.
d. The methods in an object are serialized.
e. All of the above are true.
Key:d

Section 17.7 Random Access Files 
17.	To create a file, you can use __________.
a.	FileOutputStream
b.	FileWriter
c.	RandomAccessFile
d.	All of the above.
Key:d

#		
18.	Which of the following is the legal mode for creating a new RandomAccessFile stream?
a.	"w"
b.	'r'
c.	"rw"
d.	"rwx"
Key:c

#		
19.	What happens if the file test.dat does not exist when you attempt to compile and run the following code?

import java.io.*;

class Test  {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      RandomAccessFile raf =
        new RandomAccessFile("test.dat", "r");
      int i = raf.readInt();
    }
    catch(IOException ex) {
      System.out.println("IO exception");
    }
  }
}
a.	The program does not compile because raf is not created correctly.
b.	The program does not compile because readInt() is not implemented in RandomAccessFile.
c.	The program compiles, but throws IOException because the file test.dat doesn't exist. The program displays IO exception.
d.	The program compiles and runs fine, but nothing is displayed on the console.
Key:c The problem is in line: new RandomAccessFile("test.dat", "r"); Because the file does not exist, you cannot open it for reading.

#
20. With which I/O class can you append or update a file?

a. RandomAccessFile(), 
b. OutputStream() 
c. DataOutputStream() 
d. None of the above
Key:a
